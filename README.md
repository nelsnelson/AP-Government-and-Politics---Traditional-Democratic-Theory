## Traditional Democratic Theory

Traditional democratic theory rests on a number of key principles that specify how government decisions are made in a democracy.  Robert Dahl, one of America's leading theorists, suggests that an ideal democratic process should satisfy the following five criteria:

**Equality in Voting.**  The principle of "one person, one vote" is basic to democracy.  Voting need not be universal, but it must be representative.

**Effective participation.**  Citizens must have adequate and equal opportunities to express their preferences throughout the decision-making process.

**Enlightened understanding.**  A democratic society must be a marketplace of ideas.  A free press and free speech are essential to civic understanding.  If one group monopolizes and distorts information, citizens cannot truly understand issues.

**Citizen control of the agenda.**  Citzens should have the collective right to control the government's policy agenda.  If wealthy individuals or groups distort the agenda, the people cannot make government address the issues they feel are most important.

**Inclusion.**  The government must include, and extend rights to, all those subject to its laws.  Citizenship must be open to all within a nation if the nation is to call itself democratic.

Only by following these principles can a political system be called "democratic."  Furthermore, democracies must practice majority rule, meaning that in choosing among alternatives, the will of over half the voters should be followed.  At the same time, most Americans would not want to give majority free rein to do anything they can agree on.  Restraints on the majority are built into the American system of government in order to protect the minority.  Basic principles such as freedom of speech and assembly are inviolable **minority rights**, which the majority cannot infringe on.

In a society too large to make its decisions in open meetings, a few will have to look after the concerns of the many.  The relationship between the few leaders and the many followers is one **representation**.  The literal meaning of representation is to make present once again.  In politics, this means that the desires of the people should be replicated in government through the choices of elected officials.  The closer the correspondence between representatives and their constituents, the closer the approximation to an ideal democracy.  As might be expected for such a crucial question, theorists disagree widely about the extent to which this actually occurs in America.
